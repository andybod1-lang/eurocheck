EuroCheck - EU Company Identifier

## Summary (250 chars max)
Instantly see if a website belongs to an EU or non-EU company. 100% local lookups—no data ever leaves your browser. Open source, privacy-first, zero tracking.

## Description

### Know Who You're Dealing With

EuroCheck adds a simple flag icon to your toolbar showing whether the website you're visiting belongs to an EU or non-EU company. One glance tells you what you need to know.

🇪🇺 **EU company** — subject to GDPR and EU consumer protection laws  
🌐 **Non-EU company** — different regulatory framework applies  
❓ **Unknown** — company not yet in our database

### Why It Matters

- **Privacy rights** — EU companies must comply with GDPR
- **Consumer protection** — Know your legal recourse
- **Data sovereignty** — Make informed choices about where your data goes
- **Shopping decisions** — Support businesses in your preferred jurisdiction

### Features

✅ **Instant identification** — Flag appears immediately as you browse  
✅ **Ownership chains** — See the full corporate hierarchy (who really owns the service)  
✅ **Comprehensive database** — 321 companies covering 270+ domains  
✅ **Regular updates** — Database continuously expanded  

### 🔒 Privacy-First Design

**We built EuroCheck the way browser extensions should be built:**

- ⭐ **100% local lookups** — All data is bundled with the extension
- ⭐ **Zero network requests** — Nothing is ever sent anywhere
- ⭐ **No analytics** — We don't track you, period
- ⭐ **No accounts** — Just install and go
- ⭐ **Minimal permissions** — Only what's strictly necessary

Your browsing history stays yours. We couldn't track you even if we wanted to—the extension simply doesn't have that capability.

### 🔓 Open Source

EuroCheck is **free and open source** under the MIT license.
