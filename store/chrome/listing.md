## Description

### Know Who You're Buying From

Ever wondered if that online store is actually European? EuroCheck shows you instantly.

A simple icon in your toolbar reveals whether the website you're visiting belongs to an EU company, a non-EU company, or is unknown. No clicking required—just glance and know.

**🇪🇺 Support European Businesses**
Make informed purchasing decisions. Whether you want to buy European for economic, environmental, or ethical reasons, EuroCheck gives you the information you need at a glance.

**🔍 See the Full Ownership Chain**
Companies aren't always what they seem. That "Swedish" brand might be owned by an American conglomerate. EuroCheck shows you:
• The company operating the website
• Their parent company (if any)
• The ultimate parent company

Follow the money and know who really benefits from your purchase.
