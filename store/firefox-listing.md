## Full Description

### Know if it's European — Instantly

EuroCheck shows you whether the website you're visiting belongs to a European company. One click, clear answer, zero tracking.

---

### 🛡️ Built for Privacy

Firefox users value privacy. So do we.

**EuroCheck sends nothing. Ever.**

• All company lookups happen locally on your device
• Zero network requests for lookups
• No tracking, no analytics, no telemetry
• Works completely offline after install
• Open source — audit the code yourself

This isn't marketing fluff. It's architecture. The entire company database ships with the extension and never phones home.

---

### 🔍 How It Works

1. Visit any website
2. Click the EuroCheck icon
3. Instantly see the company's EU status

**Status indicators:**
🟢 **Green** — European company (HQ and ownership in EU/EEA)
🟡 **Yellow** — Mixed ownership (EU brand with non-EU ultimate parent)
🔴 **Red** — Non-European company
⚪ **Gray** — Unknown / Not in database

---

### 🌳 Follow the Money

Corporate ownership is complicated. A "German" company might be owned by a Japanese conglomerate. A "Swedish" brand might ultimately be Chinese-owned.

EuroCheck shows you the full ownership chain — from the brand you see to the ultimate parent company. No more guessing.

**Example:**
> "Volvo Cars" (🇸🇪 Sweden) → owned by → "Geely" (🇨🇳 China)
