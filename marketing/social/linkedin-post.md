**🇪🇺 Excited to announce: EuroCheck is now live on Chrome Web Store!**

After months of development, I'm thrilled to share a project close to my heart.

**The Problem:**
As consumers, we increasingly want to support local businesses and reduce our environmental footprint. But when shopping online, it's nearly impossible to quickly determine where products actually come from.

Labels like "European quality" or "German engineering" don't always mean what we think they mean.

**The Solution:**
EuroCheck is a free browser extension that instantly shows you the origin of products while you shop. One glance tells you if something is made in the EU, and exactly which country.

**Key Features:**
🔍 Instant origin detection on major e-commerce sites
🛡️ Privacy-first: Zero data collection, no tracking
💚 Completely free, no premium tiers
⚡ Lightweight and fast

**Why it matters:**
• Support European manufacturing jobs
• Make informed purchasing decisions
• Reduce carbon footprint from long-distance shipping
• True transparency in online shopping

**Built with privacy in mind:**
In an age of data harvesting, EuroCheck collects absolutely nothing. No accounts, no analytics, no tracking. Your shopping stays your business.

I believe transparency should be free and accessible to everyone.

I'd love to hear your feedback! What features would you like to see next?
