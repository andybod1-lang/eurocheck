**First Comment (from maker):**
"Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built EuroCheck because I was frustrated by how hard it is to know where products actually come from when shopping online.

'German engineering' that's made in China? 'Italian design' assembled in Vietnam? It's not illegal, but it's not transparent either.

EuroCheck fixes that with one simple goal: show you the truth.

It's completely free and collects zero data. I believe transparency shouldn't cost anything.

Would love your feedback — what features would make this more useful for you?"
