## Executive Summary

This analysis identifies link-building opportunities for EuroCheck by examining the competitive landscape in the EU shopping/currency conversion space.

**Key Findings:**
- "Buy European" movement is growing (confirmed via Reddit discussions)
- Limited direct competitors in the EUR conversion extension space
- Major opportunity in EU-focused directories and communities

## 3. Competitor Link Patterns (Strategic Analysis)

Based on how similar extensions succeed:

### Pattern 1: Review Site Coverage
Extensions like Honey, Keepa get links from:
- Tech review sites (TechCrunch, TheVerge, CNET)
- Personal finance blogs
- "Best extensions" roundup articles

**EuroCheck Opportunity:** Pitch to EU-focused tech sites first (smaller, more accessible), then use those as credibility for bigger sites.

### Pattern 2: Affiliate/Partner Networks
Large extensions build affiliate programs where bloggers earn commissions.

**EuroCheck Opportunity:** Not viable at current scale, but consider for future.

### Pattern 3: Community Building
Successful tools engage in:
- Reddit AMAs
- Community forums
- Discord servers
- Twitter/X communities

**EuroCheck Opportunity:** Create EuroCheck community presence in EU shopping discussions.

### Pattern 4: PR/Press Coverage
Extensions get coverage via:
- Launch announcements (Product Hunt, HackerNews)
- Problem-solving stories ("This tool saved me €X")
- Trend pieces ("Buy European" movement)

**EuroCheck Opportunity:** Craft compelling narrative around EU sovereignty + smart shopping.
