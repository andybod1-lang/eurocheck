## 3. Full Description

### The Problem

That Swedish furniture brand? Actually Chinese-owned. That hip Berlin startup? Headquartered in Delaware. Corporate ownership is complex, and knowing who you're really buying from isn't always obvious.

### The Solution

**EuroCheck** is a browser extension that instantly tells you whether the website you're visiting belongs to a European company — or not.

One click. Clear answer.

🟢 **Green** = European company  
🟡 **Yellow** = Mixed (EU presence, non-EU parent)  
🔴 **Red** = Non-European  
⚪ **Gray** = Unknown

### What Makes It Different

**Full Ownership Chains**  
Don't just see the brand — see who really owns it. EuroCheck traces ownership to the ultimate parent company, revealing relationships like "Swedish brand owned by Chinese conglomerate."

**Privacy-First Architecture**  
- All lookups happen locally on your device
- Zero data sent to external servers
- No tracking, no analytics, no cookies
- Works completely offline

This isn't just marketing speak. The entire codebase is open source — verify it yourself.

**Curated Database**  
321 companies verified against Wikidata and GLEIF (Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation). Every entry has traceable sources.

### Features

✅ One-click identification  
✅ Ownership chain visualization  
✅ Chrome & Firefox support  
✅ 100% local processing  
✅ Open source (MIT)  
✅ Multilingual (EN/DE/FR)

### Who Is This For?

- EU consumers who prefer buying European
- Privacy-conscious users who care about data jurisdiction
- r/BuyFromEU community members
- Anyone curious about corporate ownership

### Built With Privacy In Mind

I'm a solo developer from Finland who cares about both privacy and European digital sovereignty. This extension was built because I wanted it myself — and because nothing else did it right.

## 5. First Comment (Maker's Comment)

**⚠️ POST THIS IMMEDIATELY AFTER LAUNCHING**

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Pekka, a solo developer from Finland.

**Why I built this:**

I kept seeing "European alternatives" lists, but when I dug deeper, many of those "European" companies had been acquired by US or Chinese tech giants. The brand looked European. The ownership wasn't.

I wanted a simple way to know — while browsing — whether a company is actually European. Not just where it was founded, but who owns it NOW.

So I built EuroCheck.

**What makes it special:**

1. **Ownership chains** — Not just "Swedish company" but "Swedish company → owned by Chinese conglomerate"
2. **100% local** — All lookups happen on your device. I don't see what sites you visit. Nobody does.
3. **Open source** — Every line of code is on GitHub. Verify my claims.

**Current limitations (being honest):**

- 321 companies in the database — growing, but not exhaustive
- Manual curation — I verify each entry against official sources, which takes time
- Chrome & Firefox only — Safari requires an Xcode wrapper, coming later

**What I'd love from you:**

- Try it! Tell me if it works on your favorite sites
- Missing a company? Open a GitHub issue or submit a PR
- Feedback on the UI — too simple? Too complex?

Thanks for checking it out. Questions welcome! 🇪🇺

P.S. — If you find any ownership data that's wrong or outdated, please let me know. The database is only as good as the community keeping it accurate.

## 6. Gallery Assets

### Required Images

Product Hunt recommends **1270×760px** for optimal display.

| 5 | **Settings/Options** | Clean settings interface | `store-4-options.png` | ✅ Ready |

### Gallery Order Rationale

1. **Lead with positive** — Green EU badge creates positive first impression
2. **Key differentiator** — Ownership chain is what sets us apart
3. **The "aha" moment** — Red non-EU shows the problem we solve
4. **Privacy message** — Reinforces trust and positioning
5. **Polish** — Settings shows this is a complete product

### Video (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)

A 60-90 second demo video significantly increases engagement.

**Suggested structure:**
| Section | Duration | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Hook | 5 sec | "Is this website actually European?" |
| Install | 5 sec | Quick extension installation |
| Amazon demo | 10 sec | Visit Amazon → Red badge, non-EU indicator |

| Settings tour | 10 sec | Quick settings walkthrough |
| Privacy message | 10 sec | "Works 100% offline. Zero tracking." |
| CTA | 5 sec | "Open source. Free forever. Try it now." |

**Tools for creating:**

## 8. Launch Strategy

### Best Day & Time

**🎯 RECOMMENDED: Tuesday or Wednesday at 00:01 PST (10:01 EET)**

| Day | Rating | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Monday | ⚠️ Avoid | Weekend backlog, lower engagement, competition |
| **Tuesday** | ✅ Best | High engagement, fresh week, motivated hunters |
| **Wednesday** | ✅ Great | Still strong engagement |
| Thursday | 🟡 OK | Decent but declining toward weekend |
| Friday-Sunday | ❌ Avoid | Low traffic, serious users offline |

**Time reasoning:**
- PH day resets at **12:01 AM PST** (Pacific)
- Launching at 00:01 gives **full 24 hours** of visibility
- For Finland: **10:01 EET** — perfect for morning launch, full workday to respond

**Avoid launching on:**
- Major tech events (WWDC, Google I/O, etc.)
- US holidays (July 4, Thanksgiving, etc.)
- Month-end (budget cycles, less browsing)
- Same day as major product launches (check PH upcoming)

🇪🇺 Launching tomorrow: A browser extension that shows if websites are European-owned

Hey r/BuyFromEU! I built EuroCheck — a privacy-first browser extension that instantly shows whether websites belong to EU companies. 

One click shows: EU (green), mixed ownership (yellow), or non-EU (red). Plus full ownership chains so you know who REALLY owns what.

100% local processing — zero tracking. Open source.

Launching on Product Hunt tomorrow: [link]

Would love feedback from this community!
```

**Hacker News (Show HN):**
```
Title: Show HN: EuroCheck – Browser extension showing website EU/non-EU ownership

Body:
Built a browser extension that tells you if the website you're visiting belongs to a European company.

GitHub: https://github.com/andybod1-lang/eurocheck

Why: After Schrems II, data jurisdiction matters. Many "European" brands have US ultimate parents (CLOUD Act applies). Wanted to know at browse time.

How: Domain → Company lookup from bundled JSON. Company → Parent chain resolution. All local, no network requests.

Tech: Vanilla JS, MV3, 321 companies from Wikidata + GLEIF. ~50KB bundle.

Limitations: Coverage still growing. Manual curation means slow updates. "European" = EU/EEA only.

Feedback welcome, especially on data sources.
```

## 10. Getting Early Upvotes (Legitimately)

### ✅ DO

- **Notify your network** — "Check out what I launched" (not "please upvote")
- **Be active on PH first** — Comment on other products, build credibility
- **Share the story** — People vote for makers they connect with
- **Respond to every comment** — Engagement breeds engagement
- **Cross-post with context** — Explain why it's relevant to each community
- **Time your outreach** — Coordinate notifications with launch

### ❌ DON'T

- **Buy upvotes** — PH actively detects and penalizes this
- **Ask directly for upvotes** — "Please upvote" is against PH guidelines
- **Use voting rings** — Upvote-for-upvote groups get flagged
- **Create fake accounts** — Detected and banned
- **Spam unrelated communities** — Damages reputation

### Engagement Tips

- **First 4 hours are crucial** — PH algorithm weights early velocity
- **Respond substantively** — Not just "thanks!" — add value
- **Be honest about limitations** — Builds trust
- **Ask questions back** — "What features would you want?" keeps conversation going

## 11. Comment Response Templates

### Positive Feedback
```
Thanks so much! 🙏 

Really glad it's useful. If you find any companies missing from the database, GitHub issues are the fastest way to get them added — or just reply here and I'll note it!
```

### Feature Request
```
Great idea! I've been thinking about [feature] too.

Current priority is expanding the company database, but this is definitely on the roadmap. Would you mind opening a GitHub issue so we can track it? That way others can +1 and we can discuss details.
```

### Technical Question
```
Good question! Here's how it works:

[Detailed technical answer]

The code is all on GitHub if you want to dig deeper. PRs welcome if you see improvements — always happy to learn from better approaches.
```

### Criticism (constructive)
```
Fair point — thanks for the honest feedback.

[Acknowledge the specific issue]. As a solo developer, [explain constraint/tradeoff]. I'm definitely looking to improve this. Would love to hear specific ideas if you have them!
```

### "Why Europe?" Question
```
A few reasons:

1. **GDPR protection** — EU companies must comply with stronger privacy laws
2. **Data sovereignty** — Your data stays under EU jurisdiction (not CLOUD Act)
3. **Support local economy** — Keep money in the European ecosystem
4. **Transparency** — EU corporate registries are publicly accessible

But really, it's about informed choice. You might still prefer a US service for various reasons — at least you'll know where your data goes.
```

### Competitor Comparison (vs. GoEuropean)
```
Yeah, GoEuropean is great for suggesting alternatives!

EuroCheck is a bit different — it focuses on identifying the CURRENT site's ownership (including chains like "Swedish brand → now owned by Chinese conglomerate") rather than suggesting where to go instead.

Think of it as "is this European?" detector vs "here's a European alternative." Complementary tools, really.
```

### "How is this different from just Googling?"
```
You could definitely Google! But a few differences:

1. **Speed** — One click vs search, navigate, verify
2. **Ownership chains** — We trace to ultimate parent, not just brand origin
3. **Consistency** — Same methodology across all companies
4. **At browse time** — Know instantly while shopping, not after checkout

It's the difference between having a map vs. asking for directions each time.
```
