# Terms of Service

**EuroCheck Browser Extension**

*Effective Date: January 26, 2026*

---

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By installing or using the EuroCheck browser extension, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, simply don't use the extension — no hard feelings.

## 2. What EuroCheck Does

EuroCheck is a free, open-source browser extension that displays EU compliance information for products and services as you browse online shops.

**Important:** EuroCheck is an informational tool only. It does not provide legal advice, financial advice, or official regulatory guidance. The information shown is meant to help you make more informed choices, but it's not a substitute for professional advice when you need it.

## 3. License

EuroCheck is open-source software released under the MIT License. You're free to use, copy, modify, and distribute it according to that license. The full license text is available in our GitHub repository.

## 4. Data Accuracy

We do our best to provide accurate and up-to-date information, but we can't guarantee it's always perfect. Compliance data may be:

- Incomplete or outdated
- Subject to interpretation
- Affected by regulatory changes we haven't yet captured

Use the information at your own discretion. When in doubt about a product's compliance status, check with official sources or the manufacturer directly.

## 5. Limitations of Liability

EuroCheck is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind.

We are not responsible for:

- Decisions you make based on information displayed by the extension
- Any damages, losses, or consequences arising from your use of EuroCheck
- Actions taken by third parties based on EuroCheck data

This is a free tool made by volunteers. Please use it as one input among many when making purchasing decisions.

## 6. Your Responsibilities

When using EuroCheck, you agree to:

- Use it for lawful purposes only
- Not attempt to manipulate or falsify compliance data
- Not use the extension to harass, deceive, or harm others
- Respect the open-source community and other users

## 7. Intellectual Property

EuroCheck is open-source. The code, documentation, and community contributions are available under the MIT License.

We welcome contributions! If you'd like to help improve EuroCheck, check out our GitHub repository. By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same MIT License.

Trademarks, logos, and brand names of third-party products shown in compliance data belong to their respective owners.

## 8. Changes to These Terms

We may update these terms from time to time. When we do, we'll update the effective date at the top.

Continued use of EuroCheck after changes means you accept the new terms. If you disagree with changes, you can stop using the extension at any time.

## 9. Termination

You can stop using EuroCheck whenever you want — just uninstall the extension. No notice required, no questions asked.

We reserve the right to discontinue the service at any time, though we'll try to give reasonable notice if we do.

## 10. Governing Law

These terms are governed by the laws of the European Union and its member states, where applicable. We aim to resolve any disputes informally first. If that's not possible, disputes will be handled in accordance with applicable EU consumer protection regulations.

## 11. Contact
