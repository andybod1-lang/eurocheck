## 1. Introduction

EuroCheck is a free, open-source browser extension that helps you identify European products and companies while shopping online. Our mission is to make it easy for consumers to support the European economy through informed purchasing decisions.

**Who we are:**  
EuroCheck is an independent open-source project. You can view our complete source code at [github.com/andybod1-lang/eurocheck](https://github.com/andybod1-lang/eurocheck).

**What EuroCheck does:**  
When you visit online stores, EuroCheck analyzes product information to determine whether items are made by European companies or manufactured in Europe. It displays this information through a simple visual indicator, helping you make purchasing decisions aligned with your values.

## 2. Data We Collect

**We collect NO personal data.**

Let us be completely clear:

- ❌ We do **not** collect your personal information
- ❌ We do **not** track your browsing history
- ❌ We do **not** store any data on remote servers
- ❌ We do **not** use analytics or tracking tools
- ❌ We do **not** create user profiles
- ❌ We do **not** collect your IP address
- ❌ We do **not** use cookies for tracking

**All processing happens locally on your device.** When EuroCheck analyzes a product page, that analysis occurs entirely within your browser. No information about what you're viewing ever leaves your computer.

---

## 3. Browser Permissions Explained

EuroCheck requests minimal permissions to function. Here's exactly what each permission does and why we need it:

### `activeTab`
**What it does:** Allows EuroCheck to read the content of the webpage you're currently viewing—but only when you actively interact with the extension.

**Why we need it:** To analyze product information on the page and determine European origin. Without this, we couldn't tell you whether a product is European.

**What it doesn't do:** This permission does NOT give us access to your browsing history, other tabs, or any pages you visit without explicitly using EuroCheck.

### `storage`
**What it does:** Allows EuroCheck to save data locally in your browser.

**Why we need it:** To store your preferences (like display settings) and cache lookup results so the extension runs faster on repeat visits.

**What it doesn't do:** This data never leaves your browser. It's stored locally, just like your bookmarks or browser settings.

---

## 4. Third-Party Data Sharing

**We share NO data with third parties.**

- We do not sell data (we don't have any to sell)
- We do not share data with advertisers
- We do not share data with analytics providers
- We do not share data with partner companies
- We do not share data with governments or authorities (again, we have nothing to share)

EuroCheck operates entirely offline after installation. There are no external API calls, no telemetry, no phone-home functionality.

---

## 5. Local Data Storage

EuroCheck stores the following data **locally on your device only**:

### What's stored:
- **Your preferences:** Display settings, enabled/disabled status, UI choices
- **Lookup cache:** Previously analyzed companies/products for faster future lookups
- **Database version:** To check if the local European company database needs updates

### Your control:
You have complete control over this data:

- **View stored data:** Check your browser's extension storage settings
- **Clear all data:** Uninstall the extension, or use your browser's "Clear extension data" feature
- **Reset settings:** Use the "Reset to defaults" option in EuroCheck's settings

### Data retention:
- Settings persist until you change or delete them
- Cache data may be periodically cleared to save space
- Uninstalling EuroCheck removes all stored data

---

## 6. Children's Privacy

EuroCheck is a general-audience tool suitable for all ages. 

**COPPA Compliance (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act):**  
We do not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age. Since EuroCheck collects no personal data whatsoever, there is no children's data to protect—but rest assured, if we ever change our data practices, we will ensure full COPPA compliance.

**GDPR-K (Children under GDPR):**  
Similarly, we comply with GDPR requirements for children's data by simply not collecting any data from users of any age.

---

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. When we do:

- **Minor changes:** We'll update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document
- **Significant changes:** We'll notify you through the extension itself (such as a notification on first run after update)

The latest version of this policy is always available at:
- Our GitHub repository: [github.com/andybod1-lang/eurocheck](https://github.com/andybod1-lang/eurocheck)
- The Chrome Web Store / Firefox Add-ons listing

We encourage you to review this policy periodically. Your continued use of EuroCheck after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

---

## 8. Your Rights (GDPR)

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have rights regarding your personal data. Since EuroCheck doesn't collect personal data, most of these don't apply in practice—but for transparency:

- **Right to access:** You can view all locally stored data in your browser's settings
- **Right to rectification:** You can modify your settings at any time
- **Right to erasure:** Uninstalling EuroCheck deletes all data
- **Right to portability:** N/A (no personal data collected)
- **Right to object:** You can disable or uninstall EuroCheck at any time

*This Privacy Policy is written in plain English because we believe you deserve to understand how software handles your data—or in our case, how it doesn't.*
