# Privacy Policy

**EuroCheck Browser Extension**

*Last updated: January 2025*

---

## Summary

**EuroCheck collects no personal data.** The extension works entirely on your device with no external connections, no tracking, and no analytics. Your browsing activity stays private.

---

## 1. What Data We Collect

**None.**

EuroCheck does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information. Specifically:

- ❌ No browsing history
- ❌ No website URLs
- ❌ No personal identifiers
- ❌ No usage statistics
- ❌ No cookies or tracking pixels
- ❌ No IP addresses
- ❌ No device information

## 2. How the Extension Works

EuroCheck operates **entirely locally** on your device:

1. **Local Database** — The company ownership database is bundled with the extension. It is not fetched from external servers.

2. **Local Lookups** — When you visit a website, the extension checks the domain against the local database. This happens entirely within your browser.

3. **No Network Requests** — EuroCheck makes zero network requests to external servers. It works completely offline.

4. **Local Preferences** — Your settings (like language preference) are stored in your browser's local storage and never transmitted anywhere.

## 3. Data Storage

The only data stored by EuroCheck is:

| Data | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| User preferences | Browser local storage | Remember your settings |
| Company database | Extension package | Lookup company ownership |

All storage is:
- 🔒 Local to your device
- 🔒 Never transmitted externally
- 🔒 Deleted when you uninstall the extension

## 4. Third-Party Services

**None.**

EuroCheck does not use:
- Analytics services (no Google Analytics, no Mixpanel, etc.)
- Advertising networks
- External APIs
- CDNs or external resources
- Social media integrations

The extension is completely self-contained.

## 5. Permissions Explained

EuroCheck requests minimal browser permissions:

| Permission | Why It's Needed |
|------------|-----------------|
| `activeTab` | To read the current website's domain and display its EU status |
| `storage` | To save your preferences locally |

We do not request permissions to:
- Read your browsing history
- Access your bookmarks
- Read or modify website content
- Access other tabs

## 6. Your Rights

Under GDPR and other privacy regulations, you have rights regarding your personal data. Since EuroCheck collects no personal data, these rights are automatically fulfilled:

- **Right to Access** — There is no data to access
- **Right to Deletion** — There is no data to delete
- **Right to Portability** — There is no data to export
- **Right to Opt-Out** — There is no tracking to opt out of

### You Have Full Control

- ✅ **View the code** — EuroCheck is open source; verify our privacy claims yourself

## 7. Children's Privacy

EuroCheck does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. Since no data is collected, no age-related concerns apply.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy, we will:

1. Update the "Last updated" date at the top
2. Publish the new version with the extension update
3. Summarize material changes in the extension's changelog

Since EuroCheck collects no data, significant privacy-related changes are unlikely.
