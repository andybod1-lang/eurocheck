# EuroCheck - One Pager

## Elevator Pitch

**EuroCheck** is a browser extension that shows a 🇪🇺 badge when you're shopping on a European company's website. It helps privacy-conscious consumers identify businesses bound by GDPR and support the European tech ecosystem—without tracking or data collection.

---

## The Problem

Consumers increasingly want to:
- Know where their data goes (and under which legal jurisdiction)
- Support local/regional businesses
- Make informed purchasing decisions

But figuring out if a company is actually European requires research. Most people don't have time to check every brand's headquarters location.

---

## The Solution

EuroCheck makes company origin visible at the moment of decision—when you're already on a product page.

- **Simple:** One badge. No complex dashboards.
- **Private:** Zero tracking. All data stays local.
- **Open:** Fully open source. Verify everything.
