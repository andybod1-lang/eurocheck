EuroCheck

## Tagline (60 chars max)
Know when you're shopping European 🇪🇺

## Description

EuroCheck is a browser extension that shows a small EU flag badge when you're browsing product pages from European companies.

**Simple premise:** When you're on an e-commerce site, if the company is headquartered in the EU or EEA, you'll see a 🇪🇺 badge. That's it.

**Why it exists:**
- Many people want to shop more locally but don't always know company origins
- European companies operate under GDPR, meaning stronger data protection
- Supply chain transparency matters to more shoppers now
- Sometimes you just want to reduce shipping distances

**How it works:**
- Matches website domains against a curated database of European companies
- All matching happens locally in your browser
- Badge appears on product pages only (not every page)
- Works across major e-commerce sites

**Privacy-first:**
- Zero tracking or analytics
- No external requests
- No account needed
- Fully open source
- Minimal permissions

Available for Chrome and Firefox.

## First Comment (from Maker)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built EuroCheck because I kept finding myself googling "is [company] European?" while shopping online.

The extension is intentionally simple - just a flag badge when you're on a European company's site. No popups, no notifications, no gamification. Just information when you need it.

A few notes on the approach:

**On privacy:** The company database is bundled in the extension, so it never needs to phone home. Your browsing stays private. I'm a bit paranoid about extensions that track too much, so I wanted to prove you can build useful tools without surveillance.

**On the database:** It's not perfect. There are definitely European companies missing. The GitHub repo is open for contributions - if you find gaps, PRs are welcome.

**On "European":** The criteria is headquarters location in EU/EEA countries. This means some multinational companies with European HQs are included, while US companies with EU subsidiaries are not. Happy to discuss the edge cases.

Would love feedback on what would make this more useful. Thanks for checking it out!

## Maker Story (for About section)

Started as a personal script to scratch my own itch - I wanted to support European businesses but got tired of researching every company. 

Turned it into a proper extension when I realized others might find it useful too. Built it privacy-first because I don't think utility tools should come with surveillance attached.

The database is community-driven and growing. The code is open source because trust should be verifiable, not just claimed.
