# Screenshots Needed for Product Hunt

Product Hunt allows up to 8 gallery images. Here's the priority list.

---

## Required Screenshots (take these first)

### 1. Hero Shot - Badge in Action
**What:** The EU badge visible on a European company's product page
**Site suggestion:** Zalando, IKEA, or a visually clean European brand
**Framing:** Full browser window, badge clearly visible, product context obvious
**Notes:** This is the main image people see - make it count

### 2. Before/After or Comparison
**What:** Side-by-side showing a European site (with badge) vs non-European site (no badge)
**Sites:** European brand vs Amazon/US brand
**Framing:** Split screen or two screenshots composed together
**Notes:** Instantly communicates what the extension does

### 3. Extension Popup (if exists)
**What:** The extension popup/interface when clicked
**Framing:** Cropped to show just the popup, clean background
**Notes:** If there's no popup UI, skip this

### 4. Badge Close-up
**What:** Zoomed view of just the badge design
**Framing:** Cropped, showing badge in context but focused
**Notes:** Shows the design quality and subtlety

## Secondary Screenshots (nice to have)

### 5. Multiple European Sites Montage
**What:** 4-6 different European brand sites all showing the badge
**Sites:** Mix of countries - German, French, Swedish, Italian, etc.
**Framing:** Grid layout composite
**Notes:** Shows breadth of coverage

### 6. Firefox Version
**What:** Badge working in Firefox browser
**Framing:** Full browser showing Firefox UI elements
**Notes:** Proves cross-browser support

### 7. Settings/Options Page (if exists)
**What:** Any configuration options available
**Framing:** Clean screenshot of options UI
**Notes:** Skip if settings are minimal

### 8. Mobile Firefox (if supported)
**What:** Extension working on Firefox Android
**Framing:** Phone mockup frame
**Notes:** Strong differentiator if it works on mobile

## Notes

- Take screenshots at 2x resolution if possible, then resize
- Product Hunt compresses images, so start with high quality
- Test how images look at thumbnail size (small preview)
- Consider making one image that explains the concept without needing to read
