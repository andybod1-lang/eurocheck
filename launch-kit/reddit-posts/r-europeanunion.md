## Title
Made a browser extension that shows when you're shopping from European companies 🇪🇺

## Body

With all the trade discussions lately, I wanted to make it easier to know when I'm actually buying from European companies vs just European warehouses of US/Chinese companies.

Built a small browser extension called **EuroCheck**. When you're on a product page, it shows a small EU flag badge if the company is European (headquartered in EU/EEA).

**How it works:**
- Matches the website domain against a database of European companies
- Shows a subtle 🇪🇺 badge in the corner when there's a match
- Database includes companies across all EU/EEA countries
- Works on most e-commerce sites

**What counts as "European":**
- Company headquarters in EU or EEA country
- Includes all member states from Portugal to Finland
- Also includes EEA members (Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein)
- Swiss companies included too

**Not included:**
- US companies with European subsidiaries
- Dropshippers using European warehouses
- Companies that moved HQ for tax reasons but operate elsewhere

It's free, open source, and doesn't track anything. Available for both Chrome and Firefox.

The database is community-expandable - if you find European companies that are missing, you can submit them.

Would be curious if others find this useful, or if there are features that would make it more practical.

**Suggested flair:** Ask if there's a "Tools" or "Discussion" flair

**Best posting time:** European evening hours (18:00-21:00 CET)

**Engagement notes:**
- Be prepared to discuss specific country coverage
- Someone will ask about Brexit/UK - have answer ready (not included, explain why)
- Don't get into political debates, keep focus on practical utility
