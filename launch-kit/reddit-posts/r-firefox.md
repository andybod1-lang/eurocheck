## Title
[Add-on] EuroCheck - Shows EU flag on European company product pages

## Body

Just published a Firefox add-on that displays a small 🇪🇺 badge when you're browsing product pages from European companies.

**Firefox Add-ons:** https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/eurocheck-eu-company-id/

**What it does:**
Simple concept - when you're on an e-commerce site and the company is headquartered in EU/EEA, you see a small flag badge. Helps if you're trying to shop more locally or just curious about company origins.

**Firefox-specific details:**
- Passed Mozilla's full review process
- Manifest V2 (taking advantage of Firefox's continued support)
- Minimal permissions: only activates on shopping sites
- Works on Firefox for Android too

**Privacy:**
- No tracking or analytics
- No external requests
- Company database bundled in the extension
- Open source: [GitHub]

**Why Firefox first:**
Honestly, Firefox's add-on ecosystem is just better for privacy-focused tools. The review process is thorough, MV2 support means I can keep permissions minimal, and Firefox users tend to actually care about this stuff.

The Chrome version exists too (MV3, slightly different permissions model), but Firefox is the primary target.

Let me know if you run into any issues or have suggestions. First time publishing to AMO so feedback appreciated.
