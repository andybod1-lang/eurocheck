## Tweet 1 (Hook)
I got tired of googling "is this company European?" every time I shop online.

So I built a browser extension that just... tells you.

🇪🇺 EuroCheck - a small flag badge appears when you're on a European company's site.

Here's what it does (and doesn't do): 🧵

## Tweet 2 (The Problem)
Why does it matter where a company is based?

- GDPR means your data has actual legal protection
- Shorter supply chains often mean lower carbon
- Supporting local-ish businesses
- Or you just want to know

I'm not here to tell you what to buy. Just making the info visible.

## Tweet 3 (How It Works)
How it works:

1. You browse normally
2. Land on a product page
3. If the company HQ is in EU/EEA → 🇪🇺 badge appears
4. That's it

No popups. No interruptions. No "are you SURE you want to buy this??"

Just information, when relevant.

## Tweet 4 (Visual - Badge Demo)
[ATTACH: GIF or screenshot of badge appearing]

Here's what it looks like in action.

Small. Unobtrusive. There when you need it, invisible when you don't.

## Tweet 5 (Privacy Angle)
The privacy angle:

✓ Zero tracking
✓ No analytics
✓ No external requests
✓ Company database bundled locally
✓ No account needed
✓ Fully open source

Your browsing habits are none of my business.

## Tweet 6 (Technical Details)
For the nerds:

- ~500 European companies in the database (and growing)
- Manifest V3 for Chrome, V2 for Firefox
- Matching happens entirely in-browser
- Service worker architecture (no persistent background process)
- MIT licensed

PRs welcome for adding companies.

## Tweet 7 (What Counts as European)
"What counts as European?"

→ Company headquarters in EU or EEA
→ Includes all 27 EU members + Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein
→ Switzerland included
→ UK not included (no longer EU)

Edge cases exist. The database is transparent and debatable.

---

## Tweet 8 (Limitations - Honesty)
What it DOESN'T do:

✗ Doesn't verify where products are manufactured
✗ Doesn't check if warehouses are local
✗ Doesn't rate companies on ethics
✗ Can't catch every European company

It's a starting point, not a complete solution.
