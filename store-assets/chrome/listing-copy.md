## Detailed Description

### Is it European? Now you'll know.

EuroCheck instantly reveals whether a website belongs to a European company — or not. One click. Clear answer. No guesswork.

### Why does it matter?

That eco-friendly Swedish furniture brand? Owned by a Chinese conglomerate. That trendy Berlin startup? Headquartered in Delaware. Corporate structures are complex. EuroCheck makes them simple.

Whether you're a conscious consumer supporting EU businesses, a privacy advocate mindful of data jurisdictions, or simply curious — EuroCheck gives you the transparency you deserve.

### 🔍 What You Get

**Instant Visual Identification**
A colored badge tells you everything at a glance:
• 🟢 Green — European (HQ and ownership in EU/EEA)
• 🟡 Yellow — Mixed (EU presence, but non-EU parent company)  
• 🔴 Red — Non-European
• ⚪ Gray — Not in database yet

**Ownership Chain Tracking**
See beyond the brand. EuroCheck traces corporate ownership to the ultimate parent company. Discover who really owns what — like revealing that a familiar European name is actually a subsidiary of a multinational.
