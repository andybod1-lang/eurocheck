## Full Description (Firefox AMO formatted)

**Know if it's European — with one click.**

EuroCheck shows you whether the website you're visiting belongs to a European or non-European company. Make informed decisions about which businesses you support.

### 🔒 Privacy by Design

Unlike other extensions, EuroCheck respects your privacy:

• **100% local lookups** — Company data stays on your device
• **No network requests** — Works completely offline
• **No tracking or analytics** — We collect zero user data
• **Open source** — Every line of code is auditable on GitHub

### 🔍 How It Works

When you visit a website, EuroCheck checks its built-in database of 320+ companies and shows a simple color-coded badge:

🟢 **Green** — European company (HQ and ownership in EU/EEA)
🟡 **Yellow** — Mixed ownership (EU presence, but non-EU ultimate parent)
🔴 **Red** — Non-European company
⚪ **Gray** — Unknown or not yet in database

### 🌳 Trace Ownership Chains

Many companies appear European on the surface but are owned by non-EU parent corporations. EuroCheck reveals the full ownership chain so you can see who really controls the business.

• Color-coded toolbar badge for quick reference
• Clean, informative popup with company details
