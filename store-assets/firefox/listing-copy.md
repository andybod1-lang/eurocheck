## Detailed Description

### Is it European? Now you'll know.

EuroCheck instantly reveals whether a website belongs to a European company — or not. One click. Clear answer. Zero tracking.

### 🔒 Built for Privacy

You chose Firefox for a reason. EuroCheck respects that choice:

• **100% Local Processing** — All lookups happen on your device, not a server
• **Zero Network Requests** — Works completely offline after install
• **No Analytics** — No tracking pixels, no telemetry, no data collection
• **Minimal Permissions** — Only requests what's strictly needed (`activeTab`, `storage`)
• **Open Source** — MIT license, fully auditable code on GitHub
• **No Account Required** — Install and use immediately

Your browsing history never leaves your browser. We designed it that way intentionally.

### 🔍 How It Works

When you visit a website, EuroCheck checks its built-in database and shows you a color-coded badge:

• 🟢 **Green** — European company (HQ and ownership in EU/EEA)
• 🟡 **Yellow** — Mixed ownership (EU presence, but non-EU ultimate parent)
• 🔴 **Red** — Non-European company
• ⚪ **Gray** — Not in database yet

Click the badge for detailed information including company headquarters, ownership chain, and data sources.

### 🌳 Trace Corporate Ownership

That eco-friendly Swedish brand? Might be owned by a Chinese conglomerate. That hip Berlin startup? Possibly headquartered in Delaware.

EuroCheck reveals the full ownership chain — tracing companies to their ultimate parent. See beyond the marketing to who actually controls the business.

### ✨ Features
