## Executive Summary

After researching domain availability for EuroCheck (European product origin checker extension), I've identified 10 viable domain options across .com, .eu, and .app TLDs. The primary name "eurocheck.com" is taken (since 2000), so alternatives focusing on the core value proposition are recommended.
