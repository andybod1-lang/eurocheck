## FAQ Section

### Section Title
**Questions? Answers.**

#### How accurate is the data?
We research ownership structures using public filings, company registries, and verified sources. Our database covers 321 companies and growing. When ownership is genuinely complex (joint ventures, partial acquisitions), we mark it as "mixed" rather than guess.

#### What data do you collect?
None. Literally zero. EuroCheck runs entirely in your browser using a local database. We have no servers tracking your browsing, no analytics, no telemetry. We couldn't see your data even if we wanted to.

#### Which browsers are supported?
Currently Chrome, Firefox, and other Chromium-based browsers (Edge, Brave, Opera). Safari support is planned.

#### How can I contribute?
We'd love your help! You can:
- Submit new companies or corrections via GitHub
- Report inaccuracies through our feedback form
- Contribute code if you're a developer
- Simply spread the word

#### Is it really free?
Yes, completely free. No premium tiers, no "pro" version, no catch. EuroCheck is a community project built to empower consumers, not monetize them.

## Notes for Implementation

**Tone achieved:**
- Confident without being preachy
- Consumer empowerment focus ("shop smarter", "know more")
- EU sovereignty framed as choice/transparency, not nationalism
- Technical credibility (specific numbers, open source emphasis)

**Key messaging pillars:**
1. Instant, effortless information
2. Complete privacy (major differentiator)
3. Open and verifiable
4. Free with no strings

**Suggested A/B tests:**
- Headline variants: "Know Who Owns..." vs "Is It Really European?"
- CTA variants: "Add to Browser" vs "Get EuroCheck Free"
